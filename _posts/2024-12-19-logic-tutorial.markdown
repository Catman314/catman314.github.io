## Introduction
This is a quick tutorial covering logic, which will be a prerequisite to gain the most from other posts.

## Motivation
### The Pythagorean Theorem
Almost all of us know the Pythagorean Theorem: If $$a$$ and $$b$$ are the legs of a right triangle and $$c$$ is the hypotenuse, then $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$. Most people simply accept this fact without question, and some skeptics may use a measuring device to try a few cases and see that it indeed seems to work. But a good mathematician wouldn't be satisfied by just a few cases, they want to know for sure that the Pythagorean Theorem works for **any** right triangle.

Despite most people not ever being told the proof, it is really quite simple and can be explained by this figure:
