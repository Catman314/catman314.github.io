I recently came across some advice about learning mathematics in general. The advice comes from the book *Topology Through Inquiry* by Michael Starbird. I have only skimmed the mathematical content in this book so far, but from what I've seen, it may end up being one of my favorite resources.

In chapter 10, they give advice on creating ideas and solving difficult problems. Here is a summary of their points.

* **Find the essence** of the concept you're learning.
  * I think that this ultimately comes naturally from following the rest of the advice.
* **Start simple**. As George Polya said, "If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem that you can't solve. Find it."
* **Create examples**.
  * For definitions, examples can help a bit at first.
  * For theorems and problems, creating examples is VERY useful.
* **Draw pictures**.
  * By drawing a picture, you may unintentionally draw a feature which you hadn't discovered.
* **Extend theorems** and **understand the proofs**.
  * By understanding the proof, working through it yourself, you understand why the statement is true.
  * You can extend theorems much more easily if you understand the proof.
  * Figure out what parts of the hypotheses were actually used in the proof. You may be able to weaken them.

I will try to follow this advice from now on!
